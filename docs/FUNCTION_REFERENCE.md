# Roopsee Product Coverage Service Function Reference

This document explains every named Python function/method and every named frontend JavaScript function in this repo. It is meant for fast code review, mentor handoff, and future edits.

The service has four main layers:

1. Data loading: read `products.csv` and the doctor score workbook.
2. Profile rules: clean invalid quiz choices before scoring.
3. Scoring engine: calculate a product-type-aware displayed score while preserving `-100` hard blockers.
4. Frontend tester: let a tester change the quiz profile and preview the product cards users would see.

Core scoring principle:

```python
final_score = rounded_average_score(components)
```

This means the service reads only sheet-backed component scores, chooses applicable components by product type, averages them, and rounds the displayed score to a whole number. If any component is `-100`, the final score remains `-100`.

## `app.py`

### Module entrypoint

`app.py` imports `main` from `roopsee_coverage.server` and calls it only when the file is run directly.

Why it exists:

- Keeps deployment simple with `python app.py`.
- Keeps real server logic inside `roopsee_coverage/server.py`.

Snippet:

```python
from roopsee_coverage.server import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## `roopsee_coverage/models.py`

### `ScoreRow`

`ScoreRow` is a dataclass, not a custom function, but it is the central data shape for one product row from the doctor score workbook.

Fields:

- `source_sheet`: which score sheet the row came from, such as `Face and body`, `Lips`, or `Eyes`.
- `product_uid`: doctor-sheet product UID.
- `product_name`, `brand`, `category`, `product_type`: product metadata from the score workbook.
- `hero_ingredient`, `secondary_ingredients`: score-sheet ingredient context.
- `scores`: dictionary of score column name to numeric score.
- `source_row`: Excel row number for traceability.

Why it exists:

- Gives the scoring engine a clean, typed row instead of raw Excel cells.

## `roopsee_coverage/utils.py`

### `clean_text(value)`

Normalizes any raw cell/CSV value into a trimmed string.

What it does:

- Converts `None` to an empty string.
- Replaces non-breaking spaces.
- Collapses repeated whitespace.
- Strips leading/trailing spaces.

Why it exists:

- Excel/CSV data often contains invisible spacing differences.
- All later matching depends on stable text.

Example:

```python
clean_text("  Dark\u00a0Spots  ")  # "Dark Spots"
```

### `norm_key(value)`

Creates a compact matching key from product IDs or similar identifiers.

What it does:

- Lowercases the value.
- Removes everything except letters and numbers.

Why it exists:

- Lets `Roopsee/F/SU/13` match `Roopsee-F-SU-13`.

Example:

```python
norm_key("Roopsee/F/SU/13") == norm_key("Roopsee-F-SU-13")
```

### `norm_label(value)`

Creates a normalized label for quiz choices and column matching.

What it does:

- Lowercases the value.
- Replaces non-alphanumeric groups with spaces.
- Trims the result.

Why it exists:

- Makes labels like `Dark Spots`, `dark-spots`, and `dark spots` compare safely.

### `safe_float(value)`

Safely parses an Excel/CSV value into a float.

What it does:

- Returns `None` for empty values.
- Removes `%`.
- Returns `None` if conversion fails.

Why it exists:

- Score columns can have blanks or text.
- The scorer should only use real numeric scores.

### `first_image(raw)`

Extracts a product image URL from the CSV `images` field.

What it does:

- If the field contains a JSON list, returns the first image.
- If the field is already a plain URL, returns it directly.
- Returns empty string when unavailable.

Why it exists:

- Product CSV image data can arrive in different formats.

## `roopsee_coverage/loaders.py`

### `parse_catalog(products_csv)`

Reads `products.csv` and returns a normalized product catalog keyed by normalized product UID.

What it does:

- Opens the CSV with `utf-8-sig` to handle spreadsheet exports.
- Skips rows without `product_uid`.
- Stores product metadata used by cards and modals.
- Extracts the first image through `first_image`.
- Uses `norm_key(uid)` as the dictionary key.

Why it exists:

- Only products present in the live product CSV are shown to testers.
- It creates the catalog side of the product UID join.

Important output shape:

```python
products[norm_key(uid)] = {
    "product_uid": uid,
    "product_name": clean_text(row.get("product_name")),
    "mrp": clean_text(row.get("mrp")),
    "sp": clean_text(row.get("sp")),
    "image": first_image(row.get("images", "")),
}
```

### `parse_score_sheet(ws, source_sheet, header_row, data_start_row)`

Reads one worksheet from the doctor score workbook and converts each valid product row into a `ScoreRow`.

What it does:

- Reads column headers from `header_row`.
- Iterates product rows starting at `data_start_row`.
- Skips rows missing UID or product name.
- Converts numeric cells into the `scores` dictionary.
- Stores the original source sheet and row number.

Why it exists:

- Each score sheet has slightly different header placement.
- The scorer needs one consistent row model.

### `parse_catalog_score_rows(products_csv)`

Reads score columns directly from `products.csv` when the catalog CSV includes doctor-score columns.

What it does:

- Scans known face/body score columns such as `Acne`, `Dryness`, `Oily Score`, `Pregnancy Score`, and `Breastfeeling Score`.
- Converts numeric score values into the same `ScoreRow` model used by workbook rows.
- Uses the product catalog fields for product name, brand, hero ingredients, category, and product type.
- Adds a `+>25` alias when the CSV uses `Above 25`, so the existing age scoring map still works.

Why it exists:

- The `New products list 19062026.xlsx` rows have score columns but their Product UIDs do not overlap with the older workbook.
- Loading score-bearing catalog rows lets the tester recommend the latest 239 products alongside the older workbook-backed products without inventing scores or relying on mismatched old workbook rows.

### `load_score_rows(score_workbook, products_csv=None)`

Loads all score rows from the score workbook.

What it does:

- Opens the workbook with `openpyxl`.
- Parses the three known doctor score sheets:
  - `Face and body`
  - `Lips`
  - `Eyes`
- Also appends score-bearing product CSV rows when `products_csv` is supplied.
- Returns one combined list of `ScoreRow` objects.

Why it exists:

- The engine should not need to know Excel sheet row/header offsets.
- New catalog uploads can carry their own doctor score columns while still using the same scoring engine.

## `roopsee_coverage/profile_rules.py`

### `is_male_gender(gender)`

Checks if a selected gender value is male after label normalization.

Why it exists:

- Pregnancy and breastfeeding rules depend on gender.

### `sanitize_special_conditions(special_conditions, gender)`

Applies quiz-level safety/validity rules to selected special conditions.

What it does:

- Removes empty values.
- If gender is male, removes `Pregnant` and `Breastfeeding`.
- Records adjustment messages for removed conditions.
- If `None` is selected with another condition, removes `None`.
- Guarantees at least `["None"]` is returned.

Why it exists:

- Prevents impossible profiles like male plus pregnant from influencing scoring.
- Keeps the API transparent by returning adjustment warnings.

Snippet:

```python
if male_profile and key in PREGNANCY_RELATED_CONDITIONS:
    adjustments.append(f"Ignored {label} because selectedGender is male.")
    continue
```

### `sanitize_profile(profile)`

Returns a copy of the full quiz profile with special conditions sanitized.

What it does:

- Copies the incoming profile.
- Reads `selectedSpecialConditions`.
- Calls `sanitize_special_conditions`.
- Replaces the profile's special conditions with the sanitized list.
- Returns both the sanitized profile and adjustment messages.

Why it exists:

- The engine needs a scoring-safe profile while still preserving the original input for response traceability.

### `special_sets_for_gender(gender)`

Returns allowed representative special-condition sets for a given gender.

What it does:

- Male profiles get only `["None"]` or `["Excessive Dryness"]`.
- Other profiles can include pregnancy and breastfeeding states.

Why it exists:

- Representative profile generation should avoid invalid male pregnancy/breastfeeding cases.

## `roopsee_coverage/profiles.py`

### `_choice_sets(items, min_size=1, max_size=None)`

Builds combinations of selected items.

What it does:

- Uses `itertools.combinations`.
- Returns every list combination from `min_size` to `max_size`.

Why it exists:

- Coverage utilities use it to build allowed concern/special-condition sets.

Example:

```python
_choice_sets(["Acne", "Dryness"], max_size=2)
# [["Acne"], ["Dryness"], ["Acne", "Dryness"]]
```

### `concern_combinations()`

Builds every valid concern selection group.

What it does:

- Builds the `14C1` single-concern Face & Body combinations from the July workbook.
- Returns `14` total concern states.

Why it exists:

- The final PnC grid depends on all allowed concern states.

### `gender_free_special_states()`

Builds all special-condition states without gender filtering.

What it does:

- Includes a true empty state: `No special selected (3C0)`.
- Includes every non-empty combination of:
  - `Excessive Dryness`
  - `Pregnant`
  - `Breastfeeding`
- Adds explicit `None`.
- Returns `9` states.

Why it exists:

- The final workbook requested gender removed from the PnC calculation.
- It still separates `3C0` from explicit `None` because that was part of the requested formula.

### `gender_free_special_combinations()`

Returns only the special-condition lists from `gender_free_special_states`.

Why it exists:

- Useful when only condition arrays are needed, not display labels.

### `all_profile_combinations(include_optional_age=True)`

Generates the full profile grid.

What it does:

- Iterates skin type.
- Iterates age states.
- Iterates all concern combinations.
- Iterates all special-condition states.
- Returns profile dictionaries ready for scoring.

Formula:

```text
4 skin types * 14 concern states * 9 special states * 4 age states = 2,016 profiles
```

Why it exists:

- This is the exhaustive coverage base for the final workbook.

### `skin_concern_type_combinations()`

Generates a smaller grid using only skin type plus concern group/set.

What it does:

- Uses `Not selected` age.
- Uses no special conditions.
- Returns `4 * 14 = 56` profiles.

Why it exists:

- Helpful for seeing base product coverage without age/special-condition complexity.

### `skin_concern_special_combinations()`

Generates a mid-size grid using skin type, concern group/set, and special-condition state.

What it does:

- Uses `Not selected` age.
- Includes all `9` special-condition states.
- Returns `4 * 14 * 9 = 504` profiles.

Why it exists:

- Helps isolate the effect of special conditions.

### `representative_profiles(limit=72)`

Creates a smaller smoke-test list of realistic profiles.

What it does:

- Cycles through skin types and ages.
- Uses the 14 July-workbook single-concern choices.
- Alternates gender safely.
- Stops when `limit` profiles have been created.

Why it exists:

- Fast testing without running the full PnC grid.
- Not used as the final mathematical truth.

## `roopsee_coverage/scoring.py`

### `age_column(age)`

Maps a quiz age label to the corresponding doctor-sheet column.

Example:

```python
age_column("Under 16")  # "<16"
```

Why it exists:

- Quiz labels and workbook column names are not identical.

### `is_sensitive_profile(profile)`

Detects if the selected profile should use sensitive skin score columns.

What it does:

- Normalizes face/body concerns.
- Normalizes lips/eyes concerns.
- Returns `True` when sensitivity or sensitive-eye concerns are present.

Why it exists:

- Face products use different skin-type score columns for sensitive profiles.

### `skin_column(skin_type, sensitive)`

Returns the correct skin-type score column for face/body products.

What it does:

- Defaults unknown skin type to `Normal`.
- Returns either `{Skin Type} Score` or `{Skin Type}+Sensitive Score`.

Examples:

```python
skin_column("Oily", False)  # "Oily Score"
skin_column("Dry", True)    # "Dry+Sensitive Score"
```

### `available_scores(row, headers)`

Returns all score values available on a row for a list of possible headers.

Why it exists:

- Some concerns map to multiple possible doctor-sheet columns.

Note:

- Current core scoring uses `first_available_score` more often because it needs the source column too.

### `first_available_score(row, headers)`

Returns the first `(header, score)` pair found in the row.

Why it exists:

- Concern mappings have fallback columns, and the explanation must say which column was used.

### `sheet_score(value)`

Formats numeric scores from the sheet.

What it does:

- Converts `90.0` to integer `90`.
- Keeps non-integer values if any exist.

Why it exists:

- The UI should show clean integer scores when the sheet has integer values.

### `rounded_average_score(components)`

Calculates the displayed product score from applicable component scores.

What it does:

- Reads every applicable component score.
- Returns `0` when no components are available.
- Averages the component scores.
- Rounds the average to the nearest whole number for display and ranking.

Why it exists:

- The tool should show one score per product/profile while still exposing all source component scores in product details.

### `serum_special_conditions_for_scoring(special_conditions)`

Filters the selected special conditions before scoring a serum.

What it does:

- Removes `Excessive Dryness` from serum scoring.
- Keeps `Pregnant`, `Breastfeeding`, and `None`.
- Avoids adding a fake `None = 100` component when the only selected special condition was `Excessive Dryness`.

Why it exists:

- The doctor rule for serums skips skin-type scores and also skips the Excessive Dryness special-condition score.

### `map_special_columns(row, special_conditions, use_default_none=True)`

Maps selected special conditions to score columns on a product row.

What it handles:

- No special conditions or `None` uses the `None` score column.
- `Pregnant` maps to pregnancy safety columns.
- `Breastfeeding` maps to breastfeeding safety columns.
- `Excessive Dryness` maps to different columns depending on the sheet.

Why it exists:

- Special conditions are not one uniform column across all sheets.

Snippet:

```python
if "excessive dryness" in conditions:
    matched = first_available_score(row, ["Excessive Dryness score"])
    if not matched and row.source_sheet == LIPS_SHEET:
        matched = first_available_score(row, ["Dry Lips/Chapped Lips", "Dehydrated Lips"])
```

### `concern_headers_for_row(row, profile)`

Maps selected concerns to relevant score columns for the row's source sheet.

What it does:

- Face sheet uses `FACE_CONCERN_MAP`.
- Lips sheet uses `LIP_CONCERN_MAP`.
- Eyes sheet uses `EYE_CONCERN_MAP`.
- Ignores concerns that do not belong to the row's sheet.

Why it exists:

- A lip product should not be scored using acne columns.
- A face product should not be scored using dark-circle columns.

### `target_sheets(profile)`

Determines which score sheets are relevant for the selected profile.

What it does:

- Face/body concerns target `Face and body`.
- Lips concerns target `Lips`.
- Eye concerns target `Eyes`.
- If no concerns are selected, defaults to `Face and body`.

Why it exists:

- Keeps recommendation results focused on the selected concern group.

### `label_for_score(score)`

Converts a numeric score into a human-readable match label.

Labels:

- `>= 90`: `Excellent Match`
- `>= 80`: `Great Match`
- `>= 70`: `Good Match`
- `>= 50`: `Fits with Caution`
- Below that: `Not Recommended`

### `score_row_for_profile(row, catalog, profile)`

Scores one doctor-sheet row against one sanitized profile.

What it does:

1. Applies the product-type scoring rule.
2. Adds age score if the selected age maps to a sheet column and the product type uses age.
3. Adds concern score components only for product types that use concerns.
4. Adds skin-type score for face/body rows when the product type uses skin type; serums skip this.
5. Adds special-condition scores, with `None` as `100` and Excessive Dryness bucketed as `-100/0/100`; serums skip Excessive Dryness.
6. Adds warnings for negative safety scores.
7. Uses the rounded average of component scores as the final score unless a component is `-100`, which becomes a hard blocker.
8. Builds a product response object using live catalog data first, then score-sheet fallbacks.

Why it exists:

- This is the core trust logic of the service.

Key snippet:

```python
final_score = rounded_average_score(components)
label = label_for_score(final_score)
```

Important output fields:

- `product_uid`
- `product_name`
- `brand_name`
- `category`
- `product_type`
- `score`
- `match_label`
- `explanation`
- `component_scores`
- `warnings`

### `summarize_results(results)`

What it does:

- Counts products by category.
- Counts products by product type.
- Counts score thresholds such as `>=90`, `>=80`, `>=70`, and `>=50`.
- Stores top and bottom score from the sorted result list.

Why it exists:

- The API and coverage workbook need quick product coverage summaries.

### `threshold_counts(results, thresholds=None)`

Counts how many products meet each score threshold.

Default thresholds:

```python
[90, 80, 70, 60, 50]
```

Output example:

```python
{
    "above_90": 3,
    "above_80": 9,
    "above_70": 18,
}
```

## `roopsee_coverage/engine.py`

What it does:

- Loads the live catalog CSV.
- Loads all doctor score rows.
- Joins score rows to catalog products by normalized product UID.
- Tracks score rows that are not in the catalog.
- Tracks catalog products that have no score rows.

Why it exists:

- The rest of the app should ask the engine for recommendations, not repeatedly parse files.

### `RecommendationEngine.recommend(profile, limit=500)`

Returns scored products for one quiz profile.

What it does:

1. Sanitizes the profile.
2. Chooses relevant target sheets.
3. Scores every matched score row in the catalog.
4. Keeps the best score per product UID when a product appears in multiple sheets.
5. Sorts products by score descending, then category, then product name.
6. Caps return size between `1` and `1000`.
7. Returns profile, adjustments, summary, and product list.

Why it exists:

- This is the main API/business function used by `/api/recommend`, coverage exports, and notebook testing.

Key snippet:

```python
if existing is None or scored["score"] > existing["score"]:
    best_by_uid[catalog["product_uid"]] = scored
```

### `RecommendationEngine.health()`

### `RecommendationEngine.coverage(profiles, top_n=12)`

Runs coverage analysis across many profiles.

What it does:

- Calls `coverage_rows`.
- Counts profile statuses.
- Returns profile count, status counts, catalog count, and rows.

  - `Limited but usable`
  - `Coverage gap`

Why it exists:

- Converts raw product counts into a tester-readable coverage signal.

## `roopsee_coverage/server.py`

### `profiles_for_mode(mode, count=None)`

Chooses which profile grid to generate for coverage mode.

Supported modes:

- `skin_concern_type`
- `with_special_conditions`
- `representative`
- default full PnC via `all_profile_combinations`

Why it exists:

- Keeps API mode selection separate from profile-generation functions.

### `limit_coverage_rows(payload, row_limit=0)`

Sorts coverage rows by severity and optionally limits returned rows.

What it does:

- Sorts gaps first, strong rows last.
- Adds `total_rows`.
- Adds `returned_rows`.
- Slices rows when `row_limit > 0`.

Why it exists:

- Full coverage can be large, so previews can return weakest rows first.

### `read_request_json(handler)`

### `Handler.do_POST()`

Handles JSON POST routes.

Routes:

- `/api/recommend`: score products for one quiz profile.
- `/api/coverage`: run coverage for provided profiles or selected mode.

CLI entrypoint for workbook export.

What it does:

- Parses `--score-workbook`, `--products-csv`, and `--output`.
- Calls `export_workbook`.
- Prints export result JSON.

Why it exists:

- Lets anyone regenerate the workbook from the terminal.

## `static/index.html` JavaScript

The frontend JavaScript powers the local Roopsee-style testing studio. It does not score products itself. It sends the selected quiz profile to `/api/recommend` and renders the API response.

### `escapeHtml(value)`

Escapes text before injecting it into HTML strings.

Why it exists:

- Protects the UI from broken HTML and basic injection issues when rendering product names, explanations, images, and labels.

### `payload()`

Builds the API request body from current UI state.

What it does:

- Sanitizes special-condition state.
- Reads age and gender from select fields.
- Reads skin type, concerns, and special conditions from frontend state.

Why it exists:

- Keeps the frontend request shape aligned with `/api/recommend`.

Snippet:

```javascript
return {
  age: document.querySelector("#ageSelect").value,
  selectedGender: document.querySelector("#genderSelect").value,
  selectedSkinType: state.selectedSkinType,
  selectedFaceBodyConcerns: state.selectedFaceBodyConcerns,
  selectedLipsEyesConcerns: state.selectedLipsEyesConcerns,
  selectedSpecialConditions: state.selectedSpecialConditions,
};
```

### `selectedGender()`

Reads the selected gender from the gender dropdown.

Why it exists:

- Shared by profile payload logic and frontend pregnancy/breastfeeding filtering.

### `availableSpecialConditions()`

Returns the special-condition options allowed for the selected gender.

What it does:

- For male, removes `Pregnant` and `Breastfeeding`.
- For other selections, returns all configured special conditions.

Why it exists:

- Prevents invalid profile choices in the UI before they reach the API.

### `sanitizeSpecialState()`

Cleans the frontend's selected special conditions.

What it does:

- Removes conditions no longer allowed after gender change.
- Defaults to `None` when nothing remains.
- Removes `None` when another real condition is selected.

Why it exists:

- Keeps UI state valid even when the tester changes gender mid-flow.

### `renderChips(containerId, items, isActive, onClick)`

Renders a group of selectable chip buttons.

What it does:

- Switches `state.activeTab`.
- Updates active tab styling.
- Calls `render()`.

### Age select callbacks

- Sanitizes special conditions.
- Re-renders UI.
- Schedules recommendation refresh.

Why it exists:

- Changing gender can remove pregnancy/breastfeeding from valid choices.

### Refresh button callback

Attached to `#matchButton`.

What it does:

- Calls `recommend()`.

### Filter change callbacks

Attached to score, category, type, and sheet filters.

What they do:

- Call `renderFilteredProducts()`.

Why it exists:

- Filters are client-side over the current API result set.

### Modal backdrop callback

Attached to `#productModal`.

What it does:

- Closes the modal only when the backdrop itself is clicked.

### Escape key callback

Attached to `document`.

What it does:

- Closes the modal when the user presses `Escape`.

### Initial boot calls

At page load:

```javascript
render();
recommend();
```

Why it exists:

- The tester loads with a default profile and immediately shows product recommendations.

## Important code paths

### Recommendation path

```text
Browser state
-> payload()
-> POST /api/recommend
-> Handler.do_POST()
-> RecommendationEngine.recommend()
-> score_row_for_profile()
-> summarize_results()
-> recommend() in frontend receives JSON
-> renderFilteredProducts()
-> renderProducts()
```

### Workbook export path

```text
python tools/export_profile_coverage_workbook.py
-> main()
-> export_workbook()
-> all_profile_combinations()
-> write_coverage_sheet()
-> profile_row()
-> RecommendationEngine.recommend()
-> workbook saved to outputs/
```

### Product detail modal path

```text
Product card click
-> openProductModal(product_uid)
-> productByUid(product_uid)
-> render detail fields from currentProducts
-> closeProductModal() on close/backdrop/Escape
```

## What is intentionally not scored in the frontend

The frontend does not calculate product scores. It only:

- Builds profile input.
- Calls the API.
- Filters returned products client-side.
- Displays score bins, cards, and product details.

All scoring remains backend-driven from the Excel workbook and CSV catalog.
